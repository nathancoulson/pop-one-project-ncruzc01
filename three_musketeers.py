# The Three Musketeers Game

# In all methods,
#   A 'location' is a two-tuple of integers, each in the range 0 to 4.
#        The first integer is the row number, the second is the column number.
#   A 'direction' is one of the strings "up", "down", "left", or "right".
#   A 'board' is a list of 5 lists, each containing 5 strings: "M", "R", or "-".
#        "M" = Musketeer, "R" = Cardinal Richleau's man, "-" = empty.
#        Each list of 5 strings is a "row"
#   A 'player' is one of the strings "M" or "R" (or sometimes "-").
#
# For brevity, Cardinal Richleau's men are referred to as "enemy".
# 'pass' is a no-nothing Python statement. Replace it with actual code.
